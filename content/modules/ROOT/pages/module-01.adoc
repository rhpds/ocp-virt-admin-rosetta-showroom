= Live Migration of Workloads
<Insert introduction to migration in general, both compute and storage>

Objectives
* Live migration of a virtual machine from one node to another random node

* Live migration of a virtual machine from one node to another specific node

* Live migration of a virtual machine from one node to another node on another cluster.

[compute]
== Compute Migration
During maintenance or troubleshooting, you might need to migrate a VM to a different node.
Live migration is the process of moving a running Virtual Machine Instance (VMI) to a different node without disruption.

NOTE: This is similar to the VMware vMotion feature for VMs.

In this lab, you will be performing a live migration of a virtual machine
from one compute node to another. To do this, you will access a running VM,
determine its current node, and then move it to another node.

Requirements
* The underlying PVC must use ReadWriteMany (RWX) access mode

* The pod network must not be configured with the bridge binding type.

* Ports 49152 and 49153 must be available in the VM's virt-launcher pod; live migration fails if these ports are specified in a masquerade network interface.

* CPU model must match on the source and destination node

[start=1]
. Access the lab
Log in to the OpenShift cluster as the <admin> user with <password> as the password.
Identify the URL for the OpenShift web console 

[start=2]
. Navigate to Virtualization -> Virtual Machines and then click on the virtual machine named vm01.
Note which worker node the VM is currently running on (example: worker-cluster-s67qr-2).
